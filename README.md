# The financial markets do punish Security breaches!

### Audience: 
The Audience for this viz would be all the companies in the market. Companies can take a note that financial markets do punish security breaches and they should be more careful with the information they have about their customers and should operate as per the security norms and should know the consequences in case such an incident happens.

### Critique for the Visualization:
The Visualization does cover the statistics about how closing stock prices suffer for the companies that experience data breaches. But it would be really helpful to include other financial factors also like Revenue or Earnings Per Share which provide additional information about how consumers reacted to the data breach. 

### Roadmap for Improvement:
In my redesign version, I will be taking into account the closing stock price statistics about the company Equifax. Because according to the reports, Equifax is the worst data breach ever far worse than Yahoo, Target, Home Depot or anything else. A failure in the credit reporting agency’s security exposed the personal information of 143 million U.S. consumers to “criminals” in the Equifax's breach. Also, I have added additional data about Revenue and EPS, how these factors changed over time and effect of security breach on them. 
I will be using bar charts and line graphs to clearly help the audience visualize the change in the values.

The Visualization suggests that the average close prices are decreasing for the companies after the data breach, which in turn shows that financial markets do punish security breaches by lowering the stock prices. For instance, I have shown company Equifax here, the company was  continuously on an increase in the closing prices for past few months but when the security breach happened in 2017 in the month of September, the stock price fell from 142.39 to 111.31. And It is still on a fall, because the brand value of the company also suffers. Investors would stop investing, customers would stop using its services.

### How Customers punished Equifax!

Here the Revenue and Earings per share are shown for Equifax.  Revenue growth illustrates increase/decrease in the business over time. For the past few years, the company was doing fine with the Revenue. But in the year of the security breach, the revenue and EPS experienced a huge fall. In 2016, Revenue was 3144 million and in the year of breach 2017, it went to 1689 million. Also, for Earnings per share, in 2016 it was 4.04 and it came down to 2.6 in 2017. It's all about trust, whenever there is an incident like this, people loose trust in the services provided by the company. And it takes a lot of time and money to build the same trust again. Still Equifax is trying to recover the loss and the controversies it is in.
